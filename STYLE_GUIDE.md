# Style guide

This project uses mainly `C++`. As every `C++` programmer knows, the language has many powerful features, but this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.
Although, for a project this size, an official style guide is probably an overshoot, in the following @alecive will keep adding useful information in terms of the style guide that this repository **strictly enforces**.

## Formatting

 * Each line of text in your code should be at most `100` characters long.
 * No trailing whitespaces. Try to set up your editor accordingly in order to avoid having trailing whitespces.
 * We use spaces for indentation. **Do not use tabs in your code.** You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.
